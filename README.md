<p align="center">
This Python-based toolbox provides functions and pipeline to process Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast MRI data acquired at 7T. In particular, functions to extract acquisition times from physiologs (Siemens format) for cardiac-gated acquisitions, correct signal by effective TR and discard inconsistent TRs as well as to filter breathing frequencies in the signal based on the signal measured by any respiratory device in a repiration physiolog (Siemens format) are available.</p>

# Code description

This toolbox so far provides the following functions:
  - `ivim_fitting.py`: fit IVIM biexponential signal representation to NIFTI data according to specified fitting approach
  - `ivim_view_fits.py`: display an IVIM parameter map and enable user to inspect fitting by clicking on any voxel and display corresponding fit plot
  - `ivim_simu_compute_error_nonoise.py`: compute error of a given fitting approach according to true IVIM values
  - `ivim_simu_plot_error_nonoise.py`: plot results from previous tool
  - `ivim_simu_compute_error_noise.py`: compute error of a given fitting approach according to true IVIM values for a given SNR (Monte Carlo simulations)
  - `ivim_simu_plot_error_noise.py`: plot results from previous tool
  - `ivim_simu_compute_required_snr.py`: compute required SNR to estimate parameters within 10% error margins for a given fitting approach and according to true IVIM values
  - `ivim_simu_plot_required_snr.py`: plot results from previous tool
  - `ivim_toolbox.py`: launch the graphical user interface
